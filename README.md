# Kam B

AI & Deeptech Architect building practical systems at the intersection of **agentic AI**, **automation**, and **reliable infrastructure**.

## What I’m focused on

- **Agent platforms & automation** (OpenClaw, tool orchestration, browser automation)
- **Memory + verification layers** for agents (fast recall, source-backed checking)
- **Production reliability** (observability, fail-safe defaults, reproducibility)

## Featured

- **ClawMemory** — SEVA-powered assist layer for OpenClaw: memory (episodic + semantic), verification, and quality modes.

## Current work style

- Prefer **shipping** and iterating.
- Bias toward **simple defaults**, **opt-in power**, and **clear failure modes**.
