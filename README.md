# Kam B

DeepTech Architect working on **agentic AI**, **memory/verification layers**, and **production-grade automation**.

## Focus

- **Algorithms & systems**: practical, measurable, reliability-first
- **Agent platforms**: orchestration, tool use, browser automation
- **Memory + verification**: fast recall, source-backed checking, quality modes
- **Infrastructure**: observability, reproducibility, fail-safe defaults

## Featured

- **ClawMemory** — SEVA-powered assist layer for OpenClaw (memory + verification + modes).

## Principles

- Ship small, iterate fast.
- Defaults should be safe; power should be opt-in.
- Prefer evidence over vibes.
